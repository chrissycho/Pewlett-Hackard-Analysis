## Project Overview
In this module, we learned to explore databases with SQL. Throughout the module, we learned to build
an employee database with SQL by applying data modeling, engineering, and analysis. For data modeling, we created
entity relationship diagrams (ERDs). For data engineering, we created a database in Postgresql using GUI(pgAdmin), where we imported data and organized them into tables. We then created queries to perform analysis to determine specific conditions
for a hypothetical company, "Pewlett-Hackard." 

## Resources
- Data Source: [departments.csv](https://github.com/chrissycho/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/Data/departments.csv), dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Software: Postgres version 12.3, pgAdmin (https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin/pgadmin4/v4.23/macos/)

## Challenge Summary
1. Technical Analysis Deliverable 1:
- Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Recent
2. Most Recent Titles

3. 











two additional analyses and a technical report to deliver the results to his manager





Delivering Results: A README.md in the form of a technical report that details your analysis and findings
Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: Number of Retiring Employees by Title. You will create three new tables, one showing number of [titles] retiring, one showing number of employees with each title, and one showing a list of current employees born between Jan. 1, 1952 and Dec. 31, 1955. New tables are exported as CSVs. 
Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: Mentorship Eligibility. A table containing employees who are eligible for the mentorship program You will submit your table and the CSV containing the data (and the CSV containing the data

In your first paragraph, introduce the problem that you were using data to solve.
In your second paragraph, summarize the steps that you took to solve the problem, as well as the challenges that you encountered along the way. This is an excellent spot to provide examples and descriptions of the code that you used.
In your final paragraph, share the results of your analysis and discuss the data that youâ€™ve generated. Have you identified any limitations to the analysis? What next steps would you recommend?

Be sure to include an image of the ERD you created when mapping out the database in your README.md.
